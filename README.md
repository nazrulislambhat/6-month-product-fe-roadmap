## 📅 Month 1 — JavaScript Mastery
**Mar 8 – Apr 8 | ~90h | Theme: Know the engine, not just the syntax**

- **Weekdays (2–3h):** Core internals — scope, closures, prototypes, `this`, `call`/`apply`/`bind`
- **Weekends (4–5h):** Async JS — event loop, microtasks, promises, async/await, generators + ES6–ES2024

### Topics
- Scope, closures, lexical environment
- Prototypes & prototype chain
- `this` keyword — all 5 binding rules
- `call`, `apply`, `bind`
- Event loop, call stack, task queue
- Microtasks vs macrotasks
- Promises (internals + chaining)
- async/await + error handling patterns
- Generators & iterators
- ES6–ES2024: destructuring, spread, modules, optional chaining, nullish coalescing
- WeakMap, WeakSet, Symbol
- LeetCode Easy: arrays & strings (20 problems)

### Resources
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) — read every section, it's the bible
- Jake Archibald: "In the Loop" (YouTube) — event loop visually explained
- You Don't Know JS (free on GitHub) — Scope & Closures + this & Object Prototypes
- LeetCode Blind 75 — arrays section

### 🚀 Month Project: JS Runtime Visualizer
> A browser tool that animates the Call Stack, Web APIs, Callback Queue, and Microtask Queue in real time as you type JS code. Users write async code and watch it execute step-by-step with color-coded blocks — like Loupe (latentflip.com) but built by you.
>
> **Stack:** Vanilla JS — no frameworks  
> **Why:** Forces deep understanding of the event loop. Impressive in interviews AND as a portfolio piece — it's a teaching tool, not a toy app.

### 🎯 Milestone
Can whiteboard-explain closures, prototype chain, and the event loop without notes.

### Topics
- Virtual DOM & reconciliation algorithm
- React Fiber — what it is & why it exists
- Render & commit phases
- Batching (React 18 automatic batching)
- All hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useId`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`
- Custom hooks — build 8+ real ones
- Context API — correct usage, pitfalls, and when NOT to use
- Compound components pattern
- Render props pattern
- Higher Order Components (HOC)
- React Portals
- Error Boundaries

Press `/` for a floating command menu (portal), drag blocks to reorder, inline markdown shortcuts auto-convert text (`##` → heading), autosave to localStorage, full undo/redo with `useReducer`.
>
> **Stack:** React + TypeScript (start adding TS here)  
> **Why:** Hits compound components, context, custom hooks, portals, drag & drop, complex state management — almost every React pattern in one project.

### 🎯 Milestone

## ⚡ Hard Truths

- **React ≠ hooks only.** Fiber, reconciliation, concurrent features, patterns — that's what "Senior" actually means in interviews.
- **Projects > tutorials.** Don't watch 5 more hours. Build the projects. Struggling through real problems is the actual learning.
- **Machine coding > DSA for Senior FE.** At Razorpay, Groww, BrowserStack — machine coding is weighted heavier than LeetCode for Senior roles.
- **Neetcode 150, not 500 random.** Pattern recognition beats random grinding every time.
- **Deploy everything. No exceptions.** "I built it locally" does not exist. Vercel is free.
- **Your Current Company Senior title is leverage.** DM engineers directly on LinkedIn. Skip job portals when possible.
- **Document your Lighthouse scores.** Put before/after numbers in your READMEs. Numbers make hiring managers stop scrolling.
